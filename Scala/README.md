# Scala Project - WIP

This is my portfolio Scala project, it's final form is currently unkown, but first idea it should be some kind of Trading Platform (what, where? I do not know yet). 

But one thing is sure - technologies I want to use:
 - Scala
 - Scalaz
 - Play
 - Spray
 - Slick

And maybe two extra modules in Haskell and Clojure.

Premises:
 - Strict TDD (also using ScalaCheck)
 - Documenting troubles and solutions
