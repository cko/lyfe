# Building Microservices - Notes

## Chapter 1. Microservices

- Microservices should be small enough but not one line code smaller
- exposed API should be technology-agnostic (ex. REST?)
- Golden rule: _can you make a change to a service and **deploy it by itself without changing anything else?**_ <- answer should be of course yes ;)
- With microservices it is easier to try new programming language, paradigm, database, framework, etc. because one has multiple new places in which to try out a new piece of technology.
